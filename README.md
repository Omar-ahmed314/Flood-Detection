# Flood-Detection

The goal of this project is to develop an automated method for detecting post-flood
damages in satellite imagery using machine learning and computer vision techniques.
The proposed solution will allow for the rapid and accurate identification of damaged
areas, enabling emergency responders to quickly prioritize their response efforts and
allocate resources more effectively. The proposed solution can also be used to monitor
the long-term impact of floods on the affected areas, allowing for more informed
decision-making and better disaster preparedness in the future.
